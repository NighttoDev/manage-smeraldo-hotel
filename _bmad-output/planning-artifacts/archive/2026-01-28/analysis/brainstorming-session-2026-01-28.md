# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Khoa
**Date:** 2026-01-28

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Comprehensive feature identification for Smeraldo Hotel management web application - transforming Excel workflows (attendance, beverage inventory, room layouts, invoices) into modern app with innovative features

**Goals:**
- Extract all functions from current Excel files
- Explore additional hotel management features beyond current Excel capabilities
- Identify innovative features that modern technology enables
- Prioritize features for implementation phases

### Context Guidance

**Current Excel Workflows:**
- Attendance tracking (Bảng chấm công 2024.xlsx)
- Beverage inventory management (Quản lý số lượng nước uống.xlsx)
- Room layout/diagram (SƠ ĐỒ PHÒNG.xlsx)
- Invoice management (Xuất hóa đơn - hóa đơn đầu vào 2024.xlsx)

### Session Setup

This session will help identify all features needed for the Smeraldo Hotel management application, going beyond current Excel limitations to leverage modern web technologies for better hotel operations management for both staff and managers.

**Platform Requirements:** Cross-platform compatibility (macOS and Windows)
**Approach Selected:** User-Selected Techniques - browsing complete technique library to choose most effective methods

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** User-Selected Techniques (Deep Analysis Category)

**Selected Techniques:**

1. **Question Storming** - Generate questions before seeking answers to properly define the complete problem space and discover what we don't know about hotel management needs
2. **Morphological Analysis** - Systematically explore all possible parameter combinations (user types × functions × permissions × data) to ensure comprehensive feature coverage
3. **Constraint Mapping** - Identify and visualize all constraints of current Excel workflows to find promising pathways for what the new app can overcome

**Selection Rationale:** This powerful combination will help us (1) discover hidden requirements through strategic questioning, (2) systematically map every possible feature combination to avoid gaps, and (3) understand current limitations to design breakthrough solutions. Together, these techniques ensure comprehensive feature identification for the Smeraldo Hotel management app.
